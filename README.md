Project Title: Airgead Banking Investment Calculator

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:  
- This C++ program calculates the future value of an investment using compound interest.  
- It solves the problem of financial forecasting by helping users understand how their money grows over time, both with and without monthly deposits.  
- The program generates two reports based on user input, making it easier to visualize long-term savings and the impact of consistent investing.

What did you do particularly well?  
- I designed a clean and modular class structure InvestmentCalculator to separate logic from the main function.  
- I implemented input validation to ensure users entered realistic and safe values.  
- I formatted the output using precision settings and structured tables to make the reports easy to read.  
- I documented the code thoroughly with comments to explain each section’s purpose and flow.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
- I could add exception handling for non-numeric input to make the program more robust and user-friendly.  
- Refactoring repetitive input prompts into reusable functions would improve maintainability and reduce redundancy.  
- These improvements would make the program more secure, adaptable, and easier to scale for broader financial scenarios.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The most challenging part was calculating compound interest with monthly deposits.  
- I overcame this by breaking the logic into smaller steps and validating each part manually.  
- I used C++ documentation, course materials, and peer examples to confirm my formulas and ensure accuracy.  
- I’m adding official documentation, instructor feedback, and peer-reviewed examples to my support network for future projects.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?  
- Object-oriented programming and class design  
- Input validation and user interaction  
- Financial modeling using compound interest  
- Code documentation and formatting for readability  
- Problem-solving and debugging in C++

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I used clear variable names and consistent formatting throughout the code.  
- I separated logic into a class to keep the program modular and easy to update.  
- I included comments to explain each section’s purpose and flow.  
- I created pseudocode before coding to stay organized and focused on the program’s structure.
